# Server Script Sanctuary

🚀 Project Status: This project is actively under development, with frequent updates and enhancements in progress.

Welcome to my curated collection of scripts and tools aimed at server administration, monitoring, and automation tasks. These scripts have been carefully crafted and updated to address a variety of scenarios encountered in real-world server and system administration.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `bash-scripts/`: Contains Bash scripts designed to assist with various server-related tasks.
  - [disk_usage_alert.sh](./bash-scripts/disk_usage_alert.sh): Monitors disk usage and sends an alert if the usage exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 90%).
- `python-scripts/`: Contains Python scripts tailored for diverse server-related tasks.
  - [api_consumer.py](./python-scripts/api_consumer.py): Designed to consume API data efficiently.
  - [backup_script.py](./python-scripts/backup_script.py): Automates the backup process for essential data.
  - [file_parser.py](./python-scripts/file_parser.py): Parses files, filters data, and writes valid entries to a new file.
  - [website_uptime_checker.py](./python-scripts/website_uptime_checker.py): Monitors website uptime and notifies of any downtimes.
- `powershell-scripts/`: Contains PowerShell scripts developed mainly for Windows server tasks.
  - [disk_usage_alert.ps1](./powershell-scripts/disk_usage_alert.ps1): Monitors the root directory's disk usage and sends an alert if the usage exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 90%).
- `documentation/`: **(Work in Progress)** Detailed documentation for each script, explaining its usage, requirements, and any other pertinent details. Comprehensive guides are being drafted, so stay tuned!

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

As the Server Script Sanctuary continues to be refined, here's a sneak peek into some of the enhancements currently being worked on:

### 🧪 Unit Tests

To ensure the reliability of the scripts, unit tests are being introduced. These will ensure that each script functions exactly as intended, catching any issues early on.

### 🌱 Advancements in Existing Scripts

The scripts here will receive periodic updates based on experiences and any feedback from the community. The aim is to optimize and expand their capabilities to ensure they remain top-notch.

### 🔍 New Scripts on the Horizon

Stay tuned for new scripts that will cater to a broader range of server and system administration tasks. The brainstorming and coding never stop!

### 🛠️ Script Customization

Future updates may include more customization options for the scripts, allowing users to tailor the scripts to their specific needs more easily.

### 🔄 Cross-Platform Compatibility

Work is being done to ensure that the scripts are compatible across different operating systems. This will make the scripts more versatile and usable in a wider range of environments.

### 🛡️ Improved Error Handling

Efforts are being made to improve error handling in the scripts. This will make the scripts more robust and reliable, even in unexpected situations.

### 🚀 Performance Optimization

The scripts are being optimized for better performance. This will make them run faster and more efficiently, saving valuable resources.

### 📚 Expanded Documentation

The documentation for each script is being expanded to include more detailed explanations, examples, and usage scenarios. This will make it easier for users to understand and use the scripts.

### 🧩 Integration with Popular Tools

Plans are underway to integrate the scripts with popular server administration and monitoring tools. This will allow users to leverage the scripts within their existing toolsets, making them even more useful.
