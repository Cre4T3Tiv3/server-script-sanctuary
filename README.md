    - [disk_usage_alert.sh](./bash-scripts/disk_usage_alert.sh)
- `python-scripts/`: Inside here are Python scripts tailored for diverse server-related tasks.
    - [api_consumer.py](./python-scripts/api_consumer.py)
    - [backup_script.py](./python-scripts/backup_script.py)
    - [file_parser.py](./python-scripts/file_parser.py)
    - [website_uptime_checker.py](./python-scripts/website_uptime_checker.py)
- `powershell-scripts/`: Contains PowerShell scripts I've developed mainly for Windows server tasks.
    - [disk_usage_alert.ps1](./powershell-scripts/disk_usage_alert.ps1)
- `documentation/`: **(Work in Progress)** Detailed documentation for each script, explaining its usage, requirements, and any other pertinent details. I'm currently drafting these, so stay tuned for comprehensive guides!

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

As I continue refining the Server Script Sanctuary, here's a sneak peek into some of the enhancements I'm currently working on:

### 🧪 Unit Tests

To ensure the reliability of my scripts, I'm working on introducing unit tests. These will ensure that each script functions exactly as intended, catching any issues early on.

### 🌱 Advancements in Existing Scripts

The scripts here will get periodic updates based on my experiences and any feedback from the community. I aim to optimize and expand their capabilities to ensure they remain top-notch.

### 🔍 New Scripts on the Horizon

I'm always brainstorming and coding! Stay tuned for new scripts that will cater to a broader range of server and system administration tasks.
